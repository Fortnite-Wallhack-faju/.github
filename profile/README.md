## 👀 What Is a Fortnite Wallhack?

A **Fortnite wallhack** is a visual cheat that renders player models, loot, and objects *through solid surfaces*. It’s often paired with **ESP** (Extra Sensory Perception), which adds overlays for player names, health bars, weapons, and more.

Perfect for:

* Spotting enemies hiding in builds
* Predicting rotations
* Looting the best chests first
* Pre-firing corners
* Surviving box fights
